SHRINK DOWN WALL CHARGER TO LAPTOP size to shrink to (1.5 inch width * 3 inch length * 0.5 inch thickness)

by resizing each individual part to a smaller part using CAD .stl files piece by piece which is less than 3-6 pieces (exterior case and circuit board inside)

shirnk down circuit to smaller compact circuit and replace larger components with Surface Mount Components



12V 200W Solar panel stays the same


laptop model chosen the laptop display plastic covering .... gets extruded to be slighter thicker for the laptop display on the backside 
which will hold the 12V 200W (12inch * 12inch solar panel in the center of the back of the laptop display)

the laptop display casing gets extruded from current 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch or 1.25 inch to allow for new parts inside of the laptop display 
housing


think $100 more per laptop display gets into laptop manufacturing lines here in north america or overseas
