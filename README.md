FINAL OUTPUT DESIGN HOPEFULLY

Calling all CAD and electronics hobbyists


SHRINK DOWN 12V CAR INVERTER 150W model to smaller laptop component size to shirnk to (1.5 inch width * 3 inch length * 0.5 inch thickness)
EXAMPLE OF A 12V CAR INVERTER TO AC 120 OUTLET

SHRINK DOWN WALL CHARGER TO LAPTOP size to shrink to (1.5 inch width * 3 inch length * 0.5 inch thickness)

by resizing each individual part to a smaller part using CAD .stl files piece by piece which is less than 3-6 pieces (exterior case and circuit board inside)

shirnk down circuit to smaller compact circuit and replace larger components with Surface Mount Components



12V 200W Solar panel stays the same

when the parts become compact parts that are small enough to fit inside of the back of the laptop plastic shell

the properitary plug like the 3 pin AC "prop" plug WILL JUST BECOME STRAIGHT SMALL GAUGE WIRES THAT ARE FACTORY SOLDERED 

(AS THIS NEW CIRCUIT DROPPING THE COST OF EXTRA PLUGS AND AC SOCKETS ETC WIRES)

then the 12" solar panel with 12V 200W............. gets wired to the 12V compact circuit inverter to where the car cigarette plug 12V input would be and the 12V compact circuit inverter AC out gets wired internally to the recharging port as a small gauge wire)


redesign the laptop display plastic shell to be 1.25 inch extruded outwards for more room to hold the 3 new parts (two compact parts and the 12" solar charing panel)

laptop model chosen the laptop display plastic covering .... gets extruded to be slighter thicker for the laptop display on the backside 
which will hold the 12V 200W (12inch * 12inch solar panel in the center of the back of the laptop display)

the laptop display casing gets extruded from current 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch or 1.25 inch to allow for new parts inside of the laptop display 
housing


think $100 more per laptop display gets into laptop manufacturing lines here in north america or overseas
